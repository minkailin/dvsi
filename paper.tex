\begin{abstract}
  Small solids embedded in gaseous protoplanetary disks are subject
  to strong dust-gas friction. Consequently, tightly-coupled dust
  particles almost follows the gas flow. 
  This property is analogous to 
  entropy  conservation
  following an adiabatic fluid.  We show that an isothermal dusty gas indeed behaves like an  
  adiabatic pure gas; and that finite dust-gas coupling may be
  regarded as an effective 
  heating/cooling. We exploit this equivalence 
  to generalize previous, well-known gaseous instabilities
  to dusty accretion disks.
%We show that strictly isothermal, non-self-gravitating, axisymmetric
%disks perfectly coupled to dust are generally stable, however thin the
%dust layer is. 
We show that in the limit of perfect coupling, dust settling in
itself cannot lead to axisymmetric instabilities, however thin the dust layer becomes.     
However, sufficiently sharp radial gradients in the dust-to-gas ratio
can destabilize the disk.  
We also extend 
the vertical shear instability (VSI) to locally isothermal, dusty 
disks. We find that  dust-loading reduces VSI growth rates, and
preferentially stabilize modes with small radial 
wavelengths, as well as `surface modes' concentrated near the
disk boundaries. 
These results can be understood in terms of 
buoyancy forces in an isothermal dusty disk. 
%We show that vertical shear arising from
%dust settling does not lead to axisymmetric instability. 
We discuss thermodynamical interpretations of 
dust-gas drag instabilities, for example the streaming
instability in protoplanetary disks, as a phase lag between the pressure 
and density of a dusty gas, much like pulsational instabilities 
in stars.

\section{Introduction}
%si, sgi as examples
Protoplanetary disks are comprised of a mixture of gas and dust
\citep{chiang10}. Although the overall dust content is small
($\sim 1\%$ by mass), their presence can have profound impacts on the 
gas dynamics and vice versa. Dust-gas friction introduces phenomena
that are absent in pure gas disks. Important examples include the
streaming instability 
\citep{youdin05a,youdin07b,johansen07}, secular gravitational
instabilities \citep{ward00,youdin11,michikoshi12,takahashi14} and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
\citep{chiang08,barranco09,lee10}. These lead to structure and
planetesimal formation, as well as turbulence. 
More recently, new 
dusty instabilities have also been uncovered through numerical
simulations \citep{loren15,loren16,lamb16}, but these are not yet well
understood. 



%particles 
Current state-of-the-art models of dusty protoplanetary
disks directly simulate gas dynamics coupled to explicit
Lagragian dust particles
\citep{nelson10,bai10,johansen11,yang14,zhu14,gibbons15,simon16,baruteau16}. 
The equation of motion for each particle is solved 
including dust-gas drag; the strength of which is measured 
by a stopping time $\tstop$ --- the decay timescale for the 
relative velocity between gas and dust. Thus small $\tstop$
corresponds to tightly-coupled particles. 

%refs 

Another approach is to model the dust population as a continous, pressureless
fluid 
\citep{paardekooper06b,meheut12,laibe12,loren14,fu14b,surville16}. The 
hydrodynamic equations are evolved for two fluids: the gas and dust with density and
velocity $\rhog$, $\bm{v}_\mathrm{g}$ and $\rhod$, 
$\bm{v}_\mathrm{d}$, respectively. Source terms are introduced into
the momentum/energy equations to model dust-gas drag. This approach
can take advantage of, and adapt, already-developed numerical methods/codes for
simulating pure gas dynamics. 

%refs 

It is possible to re-formulate the two-fluid equations into that for a
single fluid with total density $\rho$ and center-of-mass
velocity $\bm{v}$ of the dusty gas mixture
\citep{laibe14}. The standard hydrodynamic equations for
$\rho$ and $\bm{v}$ are supplemented by evolutionary equations for
the dust-to-gas ratio $\rhod/\rhog$ and the relative dust-gas velocity
$\Delta\bm{v}\equiv \bm{v}_\mathrm{d}-\bm{v}_\mathrm{g}$. The latter also contributes to 
additional source terms in the momentum and energy equations.  

The one-fluid approach is appropriate for 
simulating gas tightly coupled to dust particles with small $\tstop$.  
This can be numerically challenging for the two-fluid and Lagragian
particles framework; but is straight forward to simulate in the
one-fluid formulation \citep{price15}.  The single fluid formalism
also has the important advantage that it is 
amenable to standard analytical methods
\citep{youdin05a,jacquet11}. This is the necessary  approach to gain
physical insight and explain some of the above newer dusty
instabilities. 

In this work, we are motivated to develop a general analytical
framework to  study the stability of dusty protoplanetary
disks by drawing on the physical and mathematical parallel between dusty gas and standard
hydrodynamics. This is possible in certain limits of astrophysical
interest.  

We consider tightly coupled dust particles with $\tstop\Omega\ll
1$, where $\Omega$ is the disk orbital frequency. We may then use the
`terminal velocity approximation' to set $\Delta \bm{v} = \tstop\nabla
P/\rhog$, where $P$ is the gas pressure \citep{youdin05a,
  jacquet11,laibe14}. %This eliminates the evolutionary equation for
%$\Delta \bm{v}$. 
 We also consider irradiated protoplanetary disks 
in which the temperature is set externally
\citep{chiang97,stam08}. This allows us to adopt a locally isothermal
equation of state, $P = c_s^2\rhog$, where $c_s$ is a prescribed
sound-speed profile. This physically represents short cooling times
\citep{lin15}.   

Under these approximations, we show that the one-fluid equations of 
isothermal dusty gas dynamics are equivalent to that of adiabatic, pure gas
dynamics. This is because tightly-coupled dust particles are almost
entrained in the gas, which is is analogous to the advection
of entropy following an adiabatic fluid. We will formally relate the 
entropy of isothermal dusty gas to its dust content. Finite  
dust-gas drag can be interpreted as heating/cooling: the relative
motion between dust and gas causes a fluid parcel to exchange dust
particles with its surroundings; an effect similar to heat exchange
between a gas parcel and its surroundings.   

%suitable for 
%analytic studies 
%more importantly, can understood 

By re-casting the dusty problem into identical form as standard  
hydrodynamics, we can apply well-known methods to generalize previous stability 
analyses for pure gas disks to the dusty case. We explicitly demonstrate this for
perfectly coupled dust in strictly and locally isothermal disks. We 
show that strictly isothermal protoplanetary disks are generally
stable to axisymmetric perturbations, regardless of how  thin the dust
layer is. We also study the effect of dust-loading on the vertical shear
instability \citep[VSI,][]{nelson13,lin15,barker15}. We provide 
thermodynamical interpretations of our dusty stability calculations. 

This paper is organized as follows. In \S\ref{setup} we list the
equations describing tightly-coupled dusty gas. We show they are in 
fact the usual hydrodynamic equations in disguise. 
We describe approximate  equilibrium solutions in \S\ref{eqm}. In \S\ref{limits} we discuss
general stability properties of the dusty disk in various
limits. There, we give a thermodynamical interpretation of
instabilities caused by directly by dust-gas drag. In
\S\ref{linear_problem} we list the linearized equations, which we
solve numerically in \S\ref{results} to study the dusty VSI. We 
discuss future applications of the dusty/adiabatic gas equivalence in 
\S\ref{discussion} before summarizing in \S\ref{summary}.
