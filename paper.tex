\section{Introduction}
%si, sgi as examples
Protoplanetary disks are comprised of a mixture of gas and dust
\citep{chiang10}. Although the overall dust content is small
($\sim 1\%$ by mass), their presence can have profound impacts on the 
gas dynamics and vice versa. Dust-gas friction introduces phenomena
that are absent in pure gas disks. Important examples include the
streaming instability 
\citep[SI,][]{youdin05a,youdin07b,johansen07}, secular gravitational
instabilities \citep[SGI,][]{ward00,youdin11,michikoshi12,takahashi14,taka16,latter17} and 
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
\citep{goldreich1973, chiang08,barranco09,lee10}. 

These instabilities can trigger turbulence, and (in different regimes) promote or inhibit  
planetesimal formation. 
More recently, new 
dusty instabilities have appeared in numerical  
simulations \citep{loren15,loren16,lamb16} and analytical calculations \citep{squire17,hopkins17},   
but their physical underpinnings are not yet well 
understood. 



%particles 
Current state-of-the-art models of dusty protoplanetary
disks directly simulate gas dynamics coupled to explicit
Lagrangian dust particles
\citep{johansen2006, nelson10,bai10,yang14,zhu14,gibbons15,simon16,baruteau16}. 
The equation of motion for each particle is solved 
including dust-gas drag; the strength of which is measured 
by a stopping time $\tstop$ --- the decay timescale for the 
relative velocity between gas and dust. Thus small $\tstop$
corresponds to tightly-coupled particles. 

%refs 

Another approach is to model the dust population as a continuous, pressureless
fluid 
\citep{paardekooper06b,meheut12,laibe12,loren14,fu14b,surville16}. The 
hydrodynamic equations are evolved for two fluids: the gas and dust with density and
velocity $\rhog$, $\bm{v}_\mathrm{g}$ and $\rhod$, 
$\bm{v}_\mathrm{d}$, respectively. Source terms are introduced into
the momentum/energy equations to model dust-gas drag. This approach
can take advantage of existing numerical methods/codes for
simulating pure gas dynamics. A practical difficulty with this approach is the need to numerical stabilize the pressureless dust fluid with (e.g.) artificial diffusion.

%refs 

%AY: reworded b/c (a) I didn't think it was clear enough that the one fluid simplification wasn't exact and (b) that this tight coiupling limit needed to be emphasized more.

The two-fluid equations for dust and gas can be reformulated into 
equivalent dynamical equations for the center of mass velocity $\bm{v}$
and the relative dust-gas velocity  $\bm{v}_\mathrm{d}-\bm{v}_\mathrm{g}$ 
\citep{youdin05a}. In this reformulation, continuity equations for dust and gas can be replaced 
by the mass conservation of total density $\rho$ plus the evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio $\rhod/\rhog$ 
(or dust fraction, $\rhod/\rho$, \citealp{laibe14}).

This reformulation is particularly advantageous in the tight coupling limit of  $\tstop \ll 1/\Omega$, where the orbital frequency $\Omega$ sets the characteristic timescale in many disk dynamics problems.
Models with two fluids or with Lagrangian solids are numerically difficult to evaluate in this regime, due to stiff drag forces.  
In the reformulated equations, however, the center of mass motion does
not experience drag forces and thus is not stiff.  Moreover,
for $\tstop\Omega\ll 1$ the relative motion satisfies the terminal-velocity approximation and can be eliminated from the equations.  This single fluid framework for a well-coupled dust-gas mixture facilitates numerical calculations \citep{price15}; and also simplifies analytic calculations \citep{youdin05a,jacquet11}, which is useful for gaining insight.  

%It is possible to re-formulate the two-fluid equations into that for a
%single fluid with total density $\rho$ and center-of-mass
%velocity $\bm{v}$ of the dusty gas mixture
%\citep{laibe14}. The standard hydrodynamic equations for
%$\rho$ and $\bm{v}$ are supplemented by evolutionary equations for
%the dust-to-gas ratio $\rhod/\rhog$ and the relative dust-gas velocity
%$\Delta\bm{v}\equiv \bm{v}_\mathrm{d}-\bm{v}_\mathrm{g}$. The latter also contributes to 
%additional source terms in the momentum and energy equations.  
%
%The one-fluid approach is appropriate for 
%simulating gas tightly coupled to dust particles with small $\tstop$.  
%This can be numerically challenging for two-fluid models and 
%following Lagragian particles; but is straight forward with the 
%one-fluid formulation \citep{price15}.  The single fluid framework 
%also has the important advantage that it is 
%amenable to standard analytical methods \citep{youdin05a,jacquet11}.  
%This is the necessary approach to gain physical insight.  


%AY: Attempted to clarify a bit by separating more the analogy and it's applications.

In this work, we develop a parallel between this single-fluid description of dust-gas mixtures and standard hydrodynamics.
Specifically we recast the evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio as an energy equation for the thermal content of a fluid.
This parallel is most precise when the gas in the dust/gas mixture obeys a locally isothermal equation of state for the gas, $P = c_s^2\rhog$, where $c_s$ is a prescribed sound-speed profile.   This isothermal approximation holds when cooling times are short \citep{lin15}, e.g.\ in protoplanetary disks 
 whose temperature is set by external irradiation
\citep{chiang97,stam08}. 


%are motivated to develop a general analytical
%framework to study the stability of dusty protoplanetary 
%disks by drawing on the physical and mathematical parallel between
%dusty gas and standard hydrodynamics. This is possible in certain limits of astrophysical
%interest, allowing us to interpret dusty phenomena through standard
%hydrodynamics.   

%AY: a bit detailed for an introduction, plus the idea of terminal velocity needed to be introduced earlier as the basis of the slngle fluid equations, I thought.
%We consider tightly coupled dust particles with $\tstop\Omega\ll
%1$, where $\Omega$ is the disk orbital frequency. We may then use the
%`terminal velocity approximation' to set the dust-gas relative drift
%to $\Delta \bm{v} = \tstop\nabla
%P/\rhog$, where $P$ is the gas pressure \citep{youdin05a, 
%  jacquet11,laibe14}. This approximation reflects the physical result
%that dust particles tend to drift towards pressure maximum. 
 
% We also consider irradiated protoplanetary disks 
% in which the temperature is set externally
%\citep{chiang97,stam08}. This allows us to adopt a locally isothermal
%equation of state, $P = c_s^2\rhog$, where $c_s$ is a prescribed
%sound-speed profile. This physically represents short cooling times
%\citep{lin15}.   

Under these two approximations of strong drag and isothermal gas, we show that the equations of 
 dusty gas dynamics are equivalent to that of nearly adiabatic (i.e. slowly cooling) gas
dynamics without dust, see Fig.~\ref{concept_chart}.  The basis of the analogy is that the entrainment 
of tightly-coupled dust particles in gas flows is similar to the advection
of entropy in an adiabatic fluid. %We show that the   
%effective entropy of isothermal dusty gas scales with its gas
%fraction.  %AY: too technical for introduction.
Finite dust-gas drag act as effective heating/cooling: the relative
drift between dust and gas causes a fluid parcel to exchange dust
particles with its surroundings; an effect similar to heat exchange
between a gas parcel and its surroundings.   Needless to say the effective heating term must have a 
specific form, which we derive, for the equivalency to hold.

%suitable for 
%analytic studies 
%more importantly, can understood 

The purpose of our physical and mathematical parallel between
dusty gas and standard hydrodynamics is to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics
and stability of dusty protoplanetary disks.  
We can apply established methods to generalize previous stability 
results for pure gas dynamics to dusty disks.  
We show that strictly isothermal disks with 
perfectly-coupled dust are generally 
stable to axisymmetric perturbations, unless the 
dust-to-gas ratio varies more rapidly in radius than in height.  
%, regardless of how  thin the dust
%layer is. 
%{\bf should we mention vertically well mixed case here?} 
We put forward a thermodynamical interpretation of 
dust-gas drag instabilities, and apply it to the streaming instability.   
We also study the effect of dust-loading on the vertical shear
instability previously considered in pure gas disks
\citep[VSI,][]{nelson13,lin15,barker15}.  


This paper is organized as follows.  
In \S\ref{grow_osc} we describe a key insight of our study, that
pressure (i.e.\ ``PdV")  work {\bf can} explain the basis of several
instabilities, including SI and VSI, in terms of 
pressure-density phase lags. {\bf This motivates us to seek an 
  analogy between dust-gas mixtures and pure gas.}    
We develop our formalism in \S\ref{setup} by transforming the
two fluid equations of a tightly-coupled dusty gas into single fluid
hydrodynamic equations with a special cooling function.  Here we also
define the effective entropy and buoyancy of our model fluid. 
In \S\ref{limits} we discuss general stability properties of dusty
disks. We then analyze explicit disk models 
\S\ref{linear_problem}, were we show that radial dust edges are unstable,
and revisit the SGI and SI in the tight 
coupling regime. In \S\ref{results} we 
extend the VSI to dusty disks. We   
discuss future applications of the dusty/adiabatic gas equivalence in 
\S\ref{discussion} before summarizing in \S\ref{summary}.

% \section{Dust-free modeling of dusty protoplanetary disks}\label{key_idea}
% {\bf is this section needed?} 
% The key concept we introduce in this work is the description 
% of dusty protoplanetary disks \emph{without} explicit dust 
% equations. This is best illustrated by writing down our model   
% equations for a mixture of isothermal gas and small 
% dust particles: 
% \begin{align}  
%   &\frac{\p \rho}{\p t} + \nabla\cdot\left(\rho\bm{v}\right)= 0, \label{mass0}\\ 
%   &\frac{\p\bm{v}}{\p t} + \bm{v}\cdot\nabla\bm{v} = -
%   \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla  P - \nabla \Phi_*,\label{mom0}\\ 
%  & \frac{\p P}{\p t} + \bm{v}\cdot\nabla P 
%   = - P \nabla\cdot\bm{v} - \nabla\cdot\bm{\mathcal{F}}
% %                + \mathcal{C}(\rho, P; \tstop)
% \label{en0}, 
% \end{align}
% where $\rho=\rhod + \rhog$ is the total density, $P$ is the pressure,
% $\Phi_*$ is the stellar gravitational potential,   
% and $\bm{\mathcal{F}}=~\bm{\mathcal{F}}(\rho, P; \tstop)$ model effects of dust-gas drag, explained below. 
% %$\mathcal{C}$ represent effects of dust-gas drag, which
% %is paremterized by the stopping time $\tstop$ ($\mathcal{C}=0$ for
% %$\tstop=0$). 
% Similar equations for dusty-gas are given by
% \cite{price15}.  

% Eq. \ref{mass0}---\ref{en0} appear identical to pure gas
% dynamics, but they physically represents a two-phase, 
% dusty gas. The mixture obeys mass and momentum conservation as usual,
% but also an energy-like equation, even though the system is
% isothermal by assumption. The term $-\bm{\mathcal{F}}\propto \tstop
% \nabla P$ is not a true heat flux. Instead, it reflects 
% particle flux towards pressure maximum due to dust-gas drag 
% \citep{weidenschilling77}. The back-reaction onto the gas then changes
% the pressure distribution.      


% %weidenschilling7


% Since the above equations are similar to ideal gas dynamics, it 
% means that many of the results derived for ideal hydrodynamics can be  
% generalized to dusty disks without additional effort. This includes 
% the important consequence of phase lags between density and pressure,
% discussed next.  




\section{Growing oscillations by doing work}\label{grow_osc}
{\bf
In this section we provide physical arguments to highlight the
similarity between single phase fluids and dust-gas mixtures. It is
well-known that in the limit of perfect coupling the addition of dust
increases the gas inertia but not pressure. One can then regard the
dusty gas as a single mixture with a reduced sound-speed. Here, we
argue that when dust-gas coupling is imperfect, there exists another
similarity with pure gas related the phase of pressure and density
evolution. Thus it is still possible to regard
partially-coupled dusty-gas as a single fluid. The mathematical
description of this section is given in \S\ref{dust_work}.   
}
%dust_work

A general result in fluid dynamics is that work is done whenever
oscillations in the pressure and density of the fluid are not in
phase. If  the average work done is positive, then oscillation
amplitudes grow: the work done allows the system to `overshoot' beyond 
the amplitude of preceding oscillations.   

%To see this, we first compute the work done
%assuming periodic oscillations. We then show that if the work done is positive, then the
%oscillation amplitude in fact grows: the work done leads the
%system to `overshoot' past the amplitude of the preceeding oscillation
%cycle. 
%its equilibrium. {\bf should be overshoot the max displacement}

Fig. \ref{pdv_cartoon} gives a graphical demonstration that 
if pressure lags behind density, then positive is work done 
because it leads to a clockwise path in the 
`P-V' plane. The annotations consider the particular case where the
phase lag arises because the fluid has two components (gas and dust,
see below) but the following description is general. 

From $A$ to $B$, a fluid parcel is expanding to return to 
equilibrium, but pressure is still 
increasing. This over-compensation will cause the parcel to expand
beyond the maximum volume of the previous cycle. 
Similarly, from $C$ to $D$ the parcel is already contracting towards
equilibrium, but pressure 
is still dropping. This allows the  
parcel's contraction to over-shoot the maximum density attained in the
previous cycle. 
The overall positive work done leads to growth in the oscillation amplitude. 
This effect is similar to being pushed downwards on a swing when 
descending.


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/drag}\\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pdv}
  \caption{Thermodynamic interpretation of growing oscillations in a
    fluid. Top: pressure and density evolution in time. 
    Bottom: oscillation cycle in the P-V plane. In the case shown, 
    dust-drag causes  
    pressure (due to gas only) to lag behind total density. This results in a clockwise path in
    the P-V plane, implying positive work done by the fluid, which 
     would increase oscillation amplitudes.  
    \label{pdv_cartoon}
  }
\end{figure}

There are several situations where the pressure and density of a fluid
are not in phase. The obvious case is if the fluid is subject to
external heating/cooling. For example, in strongly irradiated
protoplanetary disks the
disk temperature  $T(r)$ is time-independent but varies with the cylindrical radius
$r$ from the star \citep{chiang97}. Since $P\propto \rhog T$ for an
ideal gas, %the pressure of a gas parcel varies with  
%position as well. 
there is no reason to expect $P$ and $\rhog$ to 
be in phase as a gas parcel oscillates between different radii and adopt the corresponding local temperatures. 
 In 
fact, we will show that this is a fundamental property of the vertical
shear instability \citep{lin15}.   

%temperature of a fluid parcel changes with position

Another possibility, as annotated in Fig. \ref{pdv_cartoon}, is a dusty gas. The
relevant density here is the total density $\rho = \rhod + \rhog$, 
but the fluid pressure $P$ is due to gas only. If dust were 
perfectly-coupled to the gas, then $P$ and $\rho$ would be in phase, 
and there is no work done. However, for finite dust-gas drag, $\rhod$ and
$\rhog$ are not necessarily in phase, because dust particles can
drift relative to the gas.   
If this causes $P$ to lag 
$\rho$, then the positive work done would lead to growing
oscillations. Indeed, we show that this is true for the streaming
instability. 

In order to apply this thermodynamic interpretation of dust-gas drag
instabilities, we need to develop a formal analogy between dusty-gas
and pure hydrodynamics. We show this is possible in the limit of
strong drag and a fixed gas equation of state.
