\section{Single fluid description of well-coupled dusty gas}\label{setup} 

\cite{laibe14}, Eq. 84 --- 85, 87: 

\begin{align}
  &\frac{D\rho}{Dt} = -\rho\nabla\cdot\bm{v}, \label{masseq}\\ 
  &\frac{D\bm{v}}{Dt} = - \nabla\Phi - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla
  P, \label{momeq}\\ 
  &\frac{D\epsilon}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla \cdot \left(\epsilon 
  \tstop \nabla P \right),\label{dusteq}  
\end{align}
where $D/Dt \equiv \p_t + \bm{v}\cdot\nabla$ is the Lagragian
derivative; 
\begin{align}
  \rho \equiv \rhog + \rhod
\end{align}
is the total density with $\rhog$ and $\rhod$ being the gas and dust
density, respectively; 
\begin{align}
  \bm{v} \equiv \frac{\rhog\bm{v}_\mathrm{g} +
    \rhod\bm{v}_\mathrm{d}}{\rho}
\end{align}
is the center-of-mass velocity with $\bm{v}_\mathrm{g}$ and
$\bm{v}_\mathrm{d}$ being the gas and dust velocities, respectively; 
and 
\begin{align}
  \epsilon = \frac{\rhod}{\rho} 
\end{align}
is the dust fraction; and $\tstop$ is the stopping time. 

\subsection{Locally isothermal equation of state for the gas} 

\begin{align}\label{eos}
  P = c_s^2(r,z)\rhog = c_s^{2}(1 - \epsilon)\rho,   
\end{align}

$c_s$ is a prescribed sound-speed profile fixed in time. 

\subsection{Effective energy equation for the mixture with a
  stationary temperature profile}   
Eliminate $\epsilon$ in favor of $P$,

\begin{align}
  \epsilon = 1 - \frac{P}{c_s^2(r,z)\rho}, 
\end{align}

Eq. \ref{dusteq} becomes

\begin{align}
\frac{DP}{Dt} = - P \nabla\cdot\bm{v} + P\bm{v}\cdot\nabla\ln{c_s^2} +
c_s^2 \nabla\cdot\left[\tstop\left(1 - \frac{P}{c_s^2\rho}\right)\nabla
  P\right]. \label{eff_energy}
\end{align}

This is the energy equation for an ideal gas of adiabatic index
$\gamma=1$, with additional source terms due to the imposed
temperature profile, as well as dust-gas friction.  

Eq. \ref{eff_energy} can be written in conservative form,

\begin{align*}
  \frac{\p P}{ \p t} + \nabla\cdot\left\{P\left[\bm{v} -
      \tstop\left(c_s^2 - \frac{P}{\rho}\right)\nabla\ln{P}\right]
    \right\}\\
  = \left[P\bm{v} - \tstop\left(c_s^2 - \frac{P}{\rho}\right)\nabla
    P\right]\cdot\nabla\ln{c_s^2}. 
\end{align*}
note: non-linear in $P$

\section{Equilibrium}

\begin{align}
  r\Omega^2 &= \frac{\p \Phi}{\p r} + \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\p P}{\p
    r},\\
  0 & = \frac{\p\Phi}{\p z} + \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\p P}{\p z}.
\end{align}

\subsection{Vertical shear}

\begin{align}\label{vshear}
  r\frac{\p \Omega^2}{\p z} = \frac{\p\ln{\rho}}{\p r}\frac{\p}{\p
    z}\left[c_s^2(1-\epsilon)\right] - \frac{\p\ln{\rho}}{\p z}
  \frac{\p}{\p r} \left[c_s^2(1-\epsilon)\right]. 
\end{align}


\section{Limiting behaviours}

\subsection{Strictly isothermal gas perfectly coupled to dust}  
When $c_s^2$ is a constant and $\tstop=0$, the dusty gas equations are
exactly equivalent to that for adiabatic hydrodyamics with unit adiabatic
index. Although the gas is strictly isothermal, the mixture behaves 
adiabatically because the dust fraction $\epsilon$ is advected with
the gas (i.e. evolves like an entropy when there is no heating or
cooling). 

In this case one may immediately apply the Solberg-Hoiland
criteria to assess axisymmtric \emph{stability}:  

\begin{align}
  \kappa^2 - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla P \cdot \nabla s &> 0,\\
  -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\p P}{\p z} \left(\kappa^2 \frac{\p s}{\p z} -
  r\frac{\p\Omega^2}{\p z}\frac{\p s}{\p r}\right) &>0, 
\end{align}  
where 
\begin{align}
  s \equiv \ln \frac{P}{\rho} = \ln{(1-\epsilon)} 
\end{align}
may be interpreted as the mixture entropy. The first equality is
similar to the usual defintion for gas entropy (with unit adiabatic
index). The second follows from the imposed equation of state,
Eq. \ref{eos}, with a constant sound-speed. 

The stability conditions are thus
\begin{align}
  \kappa^2 + c_s^2 \nabla\ln{\rhog}\cdot\nabla\epsilon &> 0,  \\
  -c_s^2\frac{\p\ln{\rhog}}{\p z}\left(-\kappa^2\frac{\p\epsilon}{\p
    z} + r\frac{\p\Omega^2}{\p z}\frac{\p \epsilon}{\p r} \right) & > 0. 
\end{align}
For accretion disks, $\rhog$ and $\epsilon$ are expected to decrease
outwards and away from the midplane, implying 
$\nabla\rhog\cdot\nabla\epsilon>0$, so the first criterion is
typically satisifed. 

To evaulate the second criterion, we can consider $z>0$ without loss
of generality. Then $\p_z\rhog,\p_z\rhod <0$, so $\p_z\rho<0$. We
assume $\p_r\rho <0$ and $\p_z\epsilon, \p_r\epsilon <0$ as
well\footnote{Due to dust sedimentation and inwards migration.}. Then,
inserting the vertical shear profile, Eq. \ref{vshear}, we find the
second criterion becomes   

\begin{align} 
  \kappa^2\left|\frac{\p\epsilon}{\p z}\right| + c_s^2\left|\frac{\p
    \epsilon}{\p r}\frac{\p\epsilon}{\p z}\frac{\p\ln{\rho}}{\p
    r}\right| - c_s^2 \left(\frac{\p\epsilon}{\p
    r}\right)^2\left|\frac{\p\ln{\rho}}{\p z}\right| > 0.  \label{criterion2}
\end{align}

This equation shows that the vertical gradient in dust-fraction (and
thus the dust-to-gas ratio $\rhod/\rhog$) has a stabilizing effect for
axisymmetric perturbations. Instead, the only way to destabilize the
system is a sufficiently large radial gradient in the dust-fraction
and/or vertical (total) density gradient (the last term).  

Note that Eq. \ref{criterion2} is only applicable for the assume disk
structure described above: decreasing dust and gas densities, as well
as the dust-fraction, away from the star and away from the
midplane. For less typical disk structures, one must evalulate above the
critera seperately. 

\subsection{Locally isothermal gas perfectly coupled to dust} 
$c_s(r,z)$ is non-uniform, but $\tstop=0$.
